##Research Objectives:  
- Developed new Statistical tools using Gaussian Statistics and multivariate analysis to correlate galaxy properties with their spatial distribution.  

##Achievement:  
• Obtained large data set (~200GB) with SQL command lines, including ~2×10^7 galaxies with 28 features.
• Wrote Struct in C for systematic data storage of multiple features.
• Designed chaining-mesh searching algorithm in C to cut down runtime by ~10^4 times.
• Performed data cleaning (~100GB FITS files) by Python and cfitsio in C.
• Constructed correlation matrices and performed multivariate conditional distribution calculation by NumPy and SciPy.
• Used C codes to compute 2-pt correlation functions to quantify galaxy spatial distribution.
• Implemented chi-squared goodness of fit to select the optimal model given the observed data using C.
• Determined measurement errors by bootstrapping and jackknife resampling methods via NumPy.
